# bam-mut-rna-seq
A comparison of genes enriched in wild type and in bam mutant

In the _Drosophila_ germline, Germline Stem Cells (GSCs) divide asymmetrically to produce both a self-renewing stem cell and a differentiating daughter cell called a Gonialblast (GB). The further differentiation of this GB is dependent of the expression of Bam. Thus, Bam mutants result in germlines containing only undifferentiated stem cell like cells. Thus, the comparison of bam mutant and wild type testis by RNA-seq gives a reasonable comparison of stem cell enriched versus differentiating enriched genes. This experiment was previously carried out in [Gan et al. Cell Research 2010](https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201064#Sec36).
